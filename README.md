## Usage

Below is a minimal example of using the library in a Scala Play application to configure and interact with the Amazon Selling Partner API.

```scala
import swagger.com.amazon.SellingPartnerAPIAA.LWAAuthorizationCredentials
import swagger.io.swagger.client.api.{OrdersV0Api, TokensApi}
import com.google.inject.Inject
import play.api.Configuration
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

class AmazonCredentials @Inject()(
                                   config: Configuration
                                 )(implicit ec: ExecutionContext) {
  private val endpoint = "https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com"

  private val lwaAuthorizationCredentials = LWAAuthorizationCredentials.builder()
    .clientId(config.get[String]("sellingPartnerApi.clientId"))
    .clientSecret(config.get[String]("sellingPartnerApi.clientSecret"))
    .refreshToken(config.get[String]("sellingPartnerApi.refreshToken"))
    .endpoint("https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token")
    .build()

  val tokensApi: TokensApi = new TokensApi.Builder()
    .lwaAuthorizationCredentials(lwaAuthorizationCredentials)
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .build()

  val ordersApi: OrdersV0Api = new OrdersV0Api.Builder()
    .lwaAuthorizationCredentials(lwaAuthorizationCredentials)
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .build()
}
```
